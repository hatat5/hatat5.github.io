<h4 id="Glioblastoma Bayes Nets">Identifying Genetic Basis for Cellularity in Glioblastoma Patients</h4>
<p>This project developed a pipeline that uses TCGA gene expression and molecular data as features and cellularity as the outcome variable to learn structures of Bayesian networks using max-min hill climbing. This networks are then model averaged using standard Bayesian model averaging and used for prediction.</p>
