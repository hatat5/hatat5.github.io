Overview:

The goal of this project is (1) to make the grading load for professors and TAs lighter and (2) to make the grading more relative and based on how fellow classmates rate a student&#8217;s work. I helped develop and implement methodologies trying to jointly estimate true grades and quality of peer review using expectation-maximation methods with cross-validation. As a teaching assistant for the EECS 349 Machine Learning course at Northwestern, we utilized some of the methodologies developed in this project to evaluate final project proposals and status reports. In the coming months, we plan to first develop better methodologies, extend these methodologies to different courses, and build an application through which this can be done.
