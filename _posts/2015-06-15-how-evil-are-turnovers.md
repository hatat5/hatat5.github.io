title: How Evil are Turnovers?

Abstract:
When Moneyball became a bestseller, every sports fan was introduced to sports analytics. All major sports statisticians suddenly began to focus on baseball for two reasons: one, because it had a plethora of objective parameters, and two, because it was the sport that began the analytics revolution. It was studied to the ground. Basketball, like baseball, has many objective and quantitative parameters. Although basketball has its analysts and has experienced some of the fervor of the Moneyball revolution, much of the sport has been left untouched. Basketball analytics experienced a revolutionary change two years ago when John Hollinger created a Player Efficiency Rating system. However, basic team analytics has always been neglected. Due to that neglect as well as the volatility and game-changing nature of turnovers, turnover differential between two teams and its effect on winning and point differential were analyzed. Turnover differential, point differential, and outcomes for each game were obtained through basketball-reference's game logs of the 2011-2012 NBA season. Two analytic techniques were employed to understand the relationships. First, the logistic regression model was used to analyze turnover differential versus outcome. Next, a linear model was used to analyze turnover differential versus point differential. Both results were significant and found a strongly negative association between the parameters. These results support the qualitative claim that turnovers have exceedingly adverse consequences for the outcomes of games. This analysis provides significant concrete quantitative insight into a previously qualitatively philosophized and unsubstantiated claim, which may lead to a decrease of risk-oriented play in the NBA.
