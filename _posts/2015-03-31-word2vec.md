title: Improving Word Embeddings with Analogical Knowledge 
---


Abstract:
Word embeddings trained on unlabeled text are valuable for a variety of NLP tasks, but how to improve the embeddings using explicitly-stated knowledge is an open question. We present a method for improving embeddings using analogical knowledge. In experiments, we show our method provides an 84% improvement in accuracy on semantic analogy tasks.
