title: Head-Neck Cancer Subtype Prediction 
--- 

Brief Overview:
In this project, we utilize a data-driven methodology to identify head-neck cancer subtypes as our ground-truth labels. These subtypes help distinguish forms of head-neck cancer from other forms and can yield in more accurate and precise treatment plans for patients with specific subtypes. Convolutional Neural Networks are used as the main classifier. Tumor images and scans are gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Two methods are proposed to predict data-driven head-neck cancer subtypes from these pathology images. The first is to construct an ensemble of fine-tuned ConvNets and use them for prediction. The second is to utilize ConvNets as a fixed-feature extractor and use a simpler classifier such as a support vector machine (SVM) for prediction.
