Abstract:
In pattern recognition, image processing, and virtually all data-driven science, a method to estimate the representative volume of a point cloud provides valuable context-specific insight to the scientist. Current methodologies have difficulties estimating highly irregularly shaped point clouds with seemingly arbitrary holes in them and fail to scale well in higher dimensional settings. In this project, a novel method, The Boundary Searcher, is developed and presented which aims to tackle these two challenges, while providing both an optimality and any-time guarantee. The performance on point clouds in two-dimensions that are sampled from a doughnut, square, and snowflake provide evidence of the robustness and accuracy of the methodology. Its constant-time computation in the number of dimensions as well as the optimality and any-time guarantee properties makes it an attractive and flexible choice for the scientist regardless of the conformational structure of the point cloud.
