				    <h4 id="PAG2ADMG">PAG2ADMG (Statistics Bachelor's Thesis)</h4>

				    <p>Novel methodology which enumerates the full set of causal graphs by converting any partial ancestral graph (PAG) to the set of all acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) that belong to the same Markov equivalence class encoded by the PAG.</p>

				    <p>[ Paper: <em>Student Abstract Accepted to AAAI 2017</em>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00099">arXiv</a> | Links: <a href="https://github.com/hatat5/pag2admg">code</a></p>

				    <h4 id="Active Hyperparameter Optimization for Deep Nets">Active Hyperparameter Optimization for Deep Nets (CS Master's Thesis)</h4>
				    
				    <p>Project in which more efficient methods for hyperparameter selection for various deep nets including LSTMs and ConvNets are being developed. We plan to submit to a leading ML conference in the next couple of months.</p>
				    
				    <h4 id="Targeted Dropout">Targeted Dropout for Deep Nets</h4>
				    <p>Project in which alternative methodologies to perform dropout to increase variance of models to improve deep neural network performance on a variety of tasks are being developed. We plan to submit to a leading ML conference in the next couple of months.</p>

				    <h4 id="Deep Ensembles">Deep Ensemble Methods for Language Modeling</h4>
				    <p>Project in which alternative methodologies to improve state-of-the-art language model performance with LSTMs are being developed. We plan to submit to a leading ML conference in the next couple of months.</p>
