## About

<p>I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist at <a href="https://scale.com">Scale AI</a>, where I work on deep learning, natural language processing, and data labeling efficiency. Previously, I worked on fake speech detection and synthesis at AI Foundation. I completed my MS in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu/" rel="noreferrer">Courant Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">NYU</a> in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/">CILVR group</a> focusing on deep learning applied to natural language processing and advised by <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/">Sam Bowman</a>. 
Before this I completed my B.A. in Statistics and M.S. in Computer Science focusing on machine learning and natural language processing at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu" rel="noreferrer">Northwestern University</a>. 
My advisor was <a href="https://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/" rel="noreferrer">Doug Downey</a>. 
I was part of the <a href="https://websail.eecs.northwestern.edu" rel="noreferrer">WEBSAIL</a> group at Northwestern specifically focusing on deep learning for language modeling.</p>
<p>Broadly, my research interests are:</p>

<p>I follow both international and club football (soccer), NBA basketball, and professional tennis very closely. Iâ€™m a huge supporter of <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.bvb.de/eng" rel="noreferrer">Borussia Dortmund</a> from the German Bundesliga. I dabble in using machine learning and statistics for sports analytics.</p>
