## About

<p>I am a predoctoral resident at <a href="http://allenai.org/">The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> on the AllenNLP team, where I work with Matt Peters on sentence representation research. I also collaborate with <a href="http://vladlen.info">Vladlen Koltun</a> on analyzing and controlling large pretrained language models. I am also an NLP researcher affiliated with <a href="https://masakhane.io">Masakhane</a>, an open source and distributed research effort for NLP for African languages.

<p>Previously, I was a predoctoral resident at <a href="http://vladlen.info/lab/">Intel's Intelligent Systems Lab</a> where I work with <a href="http://vladlen.info">Vladlen Koltun</a> on analyzing and controlling large pretrained language models. I also worked on conditional language generation, form understanding, and optical character recognition at <a href="https://scale.com">Scale AI</a> and fake speech detection and synthesis at <a href="https://aifoundation.com">AI Foundation</a>. I completed my MS in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu/" rel="noreferrer">Courant Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">NYU</a> in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/">CILVR group</a> focusing on deep learning applied to natural language processing and advised by <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/">Sam Bowman</a>. 
Before this I completed my B.A. in Statistics and M.S. in Computer Science focusing on machine learning and natural language processing at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu" rel="noreferrer">Northwestern University</a>. 
My advisor was <a href="https://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/" rel="noreferrer">Doug Downey</a>. 
<p>Broadly, my research interests are:</p>

<p>I follow both international and club football (soccer), NBA basketball, and professional tennis very closely. Iâ€™m a huge supporter of <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.bvb.de/eng" rel="noreferrer">Borussia Dortmund</a> from the German Bundesliga.</p>
