## About

<p>I am an incoming Computer Science PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu/" rel="noreferrer">Courant Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">NYU</a> in the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/">CILVR group</a> focusing on deep learning applied to natural language processing and advised by <a href="https://kyunghyuncho.me">Kyunghyun Cho</a>. 
Currently I am a Deep Learning Research Intern in the <a href="https://metamind.io/" rel="noreferrer">Metamind Group at Salesforce Research</a> in <a href="https://socher.org" rel="noreferrer">Richard Socher's</a> group. 
Before this I completed my B.A. in Statistics and M.S. in Computer Science focusing on machine learning and natural language processing at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu" rel="noreferrer">Northwestern University</a>. 
My advisor was <a href="https://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/" rel="noreferrer">Doug Downey</a>. 
I was part of the <a href="https://websail.eecs.northwestern.edu" rel="noreferrer">WEBSAIL</a> group at Northwestern specifically focusing on deep learning for language modeling.</p>
<p>Broadly, my research interests are:</p>
